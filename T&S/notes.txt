We always try to find out the time complexity in worst case scenarios

So first question comes into our mind that what is BigO Notation.
BigO notation is a measure which gives us an upper bound on the number of steps an algorithm takes
as a function of the size of the input.
BigO is basically a notation for the time and space complexity here notation means symbol...

Space complexity is the amount of space taken by an algorithm as function of input size(n).
